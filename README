A toy compiler for and learning about functional language implementation.  Oh,
and Haskell.

The language is, roughly speaking, the lambda calculus with a few built-in
functions and support for numbers.  The output is currently a bit of C++ code
that builds a tree, which can be evaluated by the runtime.

Plans:
- x86-64 assembly runtime
- Support for functions
- Support for types!
- Self-hosting

Installation notes:
- I had to hack multirec in order to get it to work the way I wanted it to.
  Clone https://github.com/jesyspa/multirec and install that.
- I use a truckload of GHC extensions, including Template Haskell, so I doubt
  this'll work on any other compilers.
- C++ compilation is done with Scons and relies on C++1y.  GCC 4.8.1 should be
  enough.
